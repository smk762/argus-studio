# Dragonhound shared design layer (dh-shared v1, currently 1.2.1)

The one source of truth for what the Dragonhound Labs sites share: dragonhound.dev (this repo,
the reference look), Studio, Lightbox and Realms. Each repo vendors a pinned copy, so there is no
runtime dependency and no CSP change. A checksum keeps the copies honest.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `dh-tokens.css` | CSS custom properties, light and dark: colour, type, space, radius, elevation, focus, motion |
| `dh-badge.css` | The demo-state badge (`.dh-badge`), styled from the tokens |
| `dh-strip.mjs` | The family bar's source: links, labels and mark as an ES module (for React/Next), plus the HTML renderer |
| `dh-strip.d.mts` | TypeScript declarations for `dh-strip.mjs` (1.2.1), vendored next to it so a typed import needs no `// @ts-ignore` |
| `dh-strip.html` + `dh-strip.css` | The family bar for the top of each demo (HTML + CSS, works without JS); generated from `dh-strip.mjs` |
| `dh-theme.js` | Light/dark that follows you across `*.dragonhound.dev` (cookie), change event and `dhTheme` API, strip current-site marking; CSP-safe |
| `dh-mark.svg` | The logo mark, simplified for small sizes (1.2 KB; same shape as `src/data/logo.ts`) |
| `favicons/` | The lab's own icons (dragonhound.dev): `favicon.svg` (dark-tab aware), `favicon.ico` (16+32), `apple-touch-icon.png` (180), `icon-192/512.png`, `site.webmanifest`. Not vendored unless asked (see Favicons) |
| `manifest.json` | Version, per-file sha256 and the set checksum (written by `--stamp`) |

Published read-only at `https://dragonhound.dev/brand/v1/` (same files plus `sync-shared.mjs`),
so a target repo's CI can compare against `https://dragonhound.dev/brand/v1/manifest.json`.

## Tokens

All names start with `--dh-`. Use the tokens; don't copy their values.

- **Colour** (light / dark, switched by `prefers-color-scheme` and overridden by `<html data-theme>`):
  `bg`, `surface`, `surface-2`, `text`, `muted`, `border`, `accent`, `on-accent`, `highlight`, `focus`,
  `success|warn|danger` each with `-ink` and `-tint`, and `demo-ink`, `demo-tint`, `demo-border`.
  - `--dh-stage-data|training|apps|foundation` (1.1.0): pipeline stage colours (data teal, training red, apps ochre,
    foundation blue). In Argus package marks they colour the single eye; any UI can use them to mark a package's stage.
    Marks and rules live in `brand/` in argus-cortex. Not for UI chrome such as links, buttons or focus.
  - **Text on a tint uses the `-ink` token**, never the fill colour. The status inks are checked against two tints: the
    `-tint` token, and a 20% mix of the fill over the background or surface (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--dh-warn) 20%, var(--dh-bg))`,
    which some sites use instead). Lowest ratios (1.2.0):

    | Ink | on `-tint` | on 20% fill over bg / surface | on bg / surface |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | light success `#14532d` | 8.0 | 6.7 / 6.9 | 8.8 / 9.1 |
    | light warn `#7a4f00` (was `#8a5a00`: 4.3 on the 20% mix) | 6.5 | 5.2 / 5.4 | 6.9 / 7.1 |
    | light danger `#7f1d1d` | 8.8 | 6.8 / 7.1 | 9.7 / 10.0 |
    | dark success `#a7e8bd` | 10.9 | 9.1 / 8.2 | 13.1 / 12.0 |
    | dark warn `#f0c36a` | 9.0 | 7.6 / 6.9 | 11.2 / 10.3 |
    | dark danger `#fbb4b4` | 9.9 | 8.0 / 7.1 | 10.8 / 9.9 |

    A stronger tint than 20% is not covered: check it before you use one.
  - `--dh-cat-1..8` (1.2.0), each with `-ink` and `-tint`: a categorical palette for facets, tags and chart series
    (blue, orange, green, red, magenta, olive, sky, slate, in that order; use them in order). Light and dark values are
    picked for separation under deuteranopia, protanopia and tritanopia (minimum OKLab distance 0.07 light, 0.08 dark,
    across all three simulations). Each fill is at least 3:1 on `bg` and `surface` (non-text: dots, bars, borders; lowest
    3.3 light, 4.5 dark). `-tint` is 20% of the fill over `--dh-surface` (a `color-mix()`); text on it uses `-ink`
    (at least 5.5:1 light, 7.0:1 dark, also on a 20% mix over bg, and at least 6.8:1 on bg/surface). Colour is never the
    only cue: keep the facet's label next to it. For a status meaning, use success/warn/danger instead.

    ```css
    .facet[data-group="1"] { background: var(--dh-cat-1-tint); color: var(--dh-cat-1-ink); border-color: var(--dh-cat-1); }
    ```
  - `--dh-accent` is for links, buttons and icons. A product may override **only** `--dh-accent` and
    `--dh-on-accent` (Studio purple, Lightbox indigo, Realms amber), at `:root`, in both schemes, and must keep 4.5:1 on `--dh-surface`.
  - `--dh-highlight` (#003366 light, #1a4d80 dark) is the card hover border and glow, and the landing logo's outline trace.
    In dark mode it is 2.1:1 on the background, so it is decorative only.
  - `--dh-focus` is the focus-ring colour: the highlight in light mode (12.2:1), a lighter tint #4a86c4 in dark mode (4.8:1 on bg, 4.4:1 on surface).
- **Type:** `--dh-font` (system-first sans, no webfont), `--dh-mono`; sizes `--dh-text-2xs` 12 px,
  `xs` 13, `sm` 14, `md` 15, `base` 16, `lg` 17, `xl` 18, `2xl` 20, `3xl` 24, `display` (clamp 1.6 to 2.4 rem);
  `--dh-leading` 1.6, `--dh-leading-tight` 1.2, `--dh-weight-semibold|bold`.
  - **Never set `font` (or `font-size`) on `html`.** The sizes are in rem, so a smaller root size shrinks every token
    (a `font: 14px/1.4 …` on `html` turns `--dh-text-2xs` into 10.5 px). Set the family and size on `body` instead:
    `body { font: var(--dh-text-base)/var(--dh-leading) var(--dh-font); }`.
  - **Text-size floor for dense tool UIs** (tables, inspectors, facet lists): nothing below `--dh-text-2xs` (12 px) on
    phones, and keep running text at `--dh-text-sm` or larger. If a desktop layout uses 11 px labels, raise them to
    `--dh-text-2xs` below 560 px.
  - **Map labels:** the floor applies to UI text (controls, tables, legends, popups). Labels drawn on a map canvas
    follow cartographic hierarchy instead and may go down to 11 px for minor places, provided they have a halo
    (a contrasting outline or glow) so they stay legible over any terrain.
- **Space:** `--dh-space-1|2|3|4|5|6|8|10|12|16` = 4 to 64 px on a 4 px base.
- **Radius:** `--dh-radius-sm` 6, `md` 8 (buttons), `lg` 10 (cards), `xl` 14, `pill`.
- **Elevation:** `--dh-shadow-1`, `--dh-shadow-hover` (the card hover: drop shadow plus a 1 px highlight ring in light mode, a highlight glow in dark mode), `--dh-shadow-color`, `--dh-glow`.
- **Focus:** `outline: var(--dh-focus-ring); outline-offset: var(--dh-focus-offset);` (2 px, 3 px offset).
- **Motion:** `--dh-dur-fast` .15 s (colour), `--dh-dur` .2 s (border, shadow, lift), `--dh-dur-slow` .35 s (image zoom),
  `--dh-dur-draw` 1.3 s (one-off reveals); `--dh-ease`, `--dh-ease-out` (entering), `--dh-ease-in` (leaving).
- **Layout:** `--dh-max` 1080 px, `--dh-gutter` 16 px, `--dh-strip-h` 30 px.

**Card hover, the house style:**

```css
.card { transition: border-color var(--dh-dur), box-shadow var(--dh-dur), transform var(--dh-dur); }
.card:is(:hover, :focus-within) { border-color: var(--dh-highlight); box-shadow: var(--dh-shadow-hover); transform: translateY(var(--dh-lift)); }
.card :focus-visible { outline: var(--dh-focus-ring); outline-offset: var(--dh-focus-offset); }
```

**Reduced motion:** movement goes through `--dh-lift`, `--dh-zoom` and `--dh-dur-draw`, which the tokens set
to `0px`, `1` and `0s` under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. Colour and opacity fades keep their
durations. So write `transform: translateY(var(--dh-lift))` and never a literal pixel lift, and you don't
need your own reduced-motion block for hover effects.

**Tailwind 4:** map in `@theme inline`, e.g. `--color-bg: var(--dh-bg); --color-accent: var(--dh-accent); --radius-lg: var(--dh-radius-lg); --font-sans: var(--dh-font);`.

## Demo-state vocabulary

Four labels replace the seven found in the audit ("RECORDED", "DEMO", "DEMO SAMPLE", "NOT IN DEMO",
"COMING SOON", "Recorded pipeline run", "demo on recorded data"). Sentence case, one badge component, a
`title` that says what it means.

| Label | Class | Use when | Example `title` |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Recorded** | `.dh-badge` | Real output from a real run, replayed. The default for every demo page. | "Recorded output from a real run; no model runs while you browse" |
| **Sample data** | `.dh-badge dh-badge--sample` | Illustrative or synthetic input or output, not from a real run. | "Synthetic sample to show the layout; not real output" |
| **In-browser** | `.dh-badge dh-badge--browser` | Computed live on the client, from your input, right now. | "Runs in your browser; nothing is sent anywhere" |
| **Not in this demo** | `.dh-badge dh-badge--off` | The feature needs the real backend (GPU, model, writes). Show the control disabled with this badge. | "Needs the self-hosted backend; see the README" |

```html
<span class="dh-badge" title="Recorded output from a real run; no model runs while you browse">Recorded</span>
```

Retired: "Demo", "Demo sample", "Coming soon" (inside a demo), "Recorded pipeline run", "demo on recorded data".
The strip's own label is fixed: "Live demo · recorded output" ("Live demo" on phones).

## Demo strip

One source, two forms: `dh-strip.mjs` exports the links, labels and mark (`strip`), plus `stripHtml({ current })`.
`dh-strip.html` is generated from it by `npm run shared:stamp`, and the build fails if the two drift.

- **Static HTML:** paste `dh-strip.html` as the first element in `<body>` after the skip link, include `dh-strip.css`
  after the tokens, and say which site this is with **`data-dh-site="studio"`** (or `lightbox`, `realms`) on `<html>`
  or on the `<nav class="dh-strip">`. Don't edit the markup: `dh-strip.css` shows the current link from that
  attribute (no JS needed), and `dh-theme.js` adds `aria-current="page"` to it, also for strips mounted later.
  A hand-set `aria-current` still works.
- **React / Next:** `import { strip } from "./vendor/dh/dh-strip.mjs"` and render it natively (the file header
  has a ready JSX snippet); set `aria-current="page"` on your own link. No HTML string replacement.
  TypeScript picks up the types from `dh-strip.d.mts` next to it (1.2.1; for a `.mjs` import TypeScript looks for `.d.mts`, not `.d.ts`).

It is a `<nav aria-label="Dragonhound Labs demos">` landmark, 30 px tall. Links are same-tab (all `*.dragonhound.dev` hosts are internal: make sure your
external-link rewriter treats them that way). Below 560 px the "Dragonhound Labs" text and "· recorded output" are
visually hidden (still read out) and, as a last resort, the bar scrolls sideways instead of wrapping.
If your header is sticky, offset it by `var(--dh-strip-h)` or put the strip inside it.

## Theme

```html
<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark">
<script src="/dh-theme.js"></script>            <!-- blocking, in <head>: sets data-theme before first paint -->
...
<button type="button" data-dh-theme-toggle aria-label="Dark theme" aria-pressed="false">…</button>
```

- External file, no inline code: covered by `script-src 'self'` under a hash or nonce CSP, and it creates no HTML (Trusted Types safe).
  With a nonce policy that has `'strict-dynamic'`, give the tag your nonce.
- Two states, system default: toggling stores an override in a `dh-theme` cookie (`Domain=.dragonhound.dev; Path=/; SameSite=Lax; Secure`, one year); toggling back to the system scheme deletes it. On other hosts (localhost, `*.pages.dev`) the cookie is host-only.
- It re-reads the cookie when a tab becomes visible again, so a change on another subdomain carries over.
- The landing page's old `localStorage.theme` is migrated once. A site with its own 3-state toggle should drop it for this one.
- Dark-only site (Lightbox): `<html data-theme="dark" data-dh-theme-lock>`, no toggle (and see "locked sites" below).
- Next.js: put the tag in the root layout's `<head>` as a plain `<script src>` (not `next/script` with `afterInteractive`), and add `suppressHydrationWarning` to `<html>`.
- **Change notification:** `document` receives a `dh-theme-change` CustomEvent with
  `detail = { theme, stored, source }`: `theme` is the effective `"light"`/`"dark"`, `stored` the override or `null`,
  `source` one of `"toggle"`, `"api"`, `"system"` (OS scheme changed), `"sync"` (cookie changed on another subdomain or tab).
  It fires only when something changed, and not for the initial state (read that with `effective()`).
- **API:** `window.dhTheme.get()` (the override or `null`), `.effective()` (`"light"`/`"dark"`), `.set("light" | "dark" | null)`,
  `.subscribe(fn)` returning an unsubscribe function. React: `useSyncExternalStore(dhTheme.subscribe, dhTheme.effective, () => "light")`.
- **Toggles mounted later** (client-side navigation, hydration) get `aria-pressed` kept in sync automatically (a
  `MutationObserver` in `dh-theme.js`; clicks are delegated), so no per-site workaround is needed.
- **Single-theme (locked) sites can skip `dh-theme.js`.** It only matters for the toggle and the cookie; set
  `data-theme` on `<html>` yourself. Vendor with `--no-theme-script` (1.2.1) to leave the file out: the lock records
  it under `omitted` (with `"noThemeScript": true`), so `--check` and `--against` still pass. Pass the flag on every re-sync. Load it anyway only if you use the static `dh-strip.html` and want `aria-current`
  (the visual state works without it). With `data-dh-theme-lock` the script leaves the theme alone, `set()` does
  nothing and `subscribe()` never fires.
- The cookie must be mentioned anywhere a site says "no cookies".

## Favicons

**These are the lab's own icons, for dragonhound.dev.** The **Argus apps (Studio, Lightbox, Realms) use the official
favicon sets from argus-cortex `brand/`**, copied unchanged (all rights reserved), and must not use the Dragonhound
lab favicons. So `sync-shared.mjs` leaves `favicons/` out of a vendored copy unless you pass `--with-favicons`
(the lock records the left-out files, so `--check` and `--against` still work).

A site that does use the lab set copies `favicons/*` to its root and adds:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.svg" type="image/svg+xml">
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="32x32">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
```

`favicon.svg` is the mark in ink #1c1f22 with a `prefers-color-scheme: dark` rule inside (light ink #e6e8ea).
The PNG and ICO sizes sit on the brand tile #1d5f74 so they read on any tab bar. Regenerate with
`npm i --no-save playwright && node scripts/build-favicons.mjs` (writes `shared/favicons/` and the landing's `public/`).
For another monochrome mark: `node scripts/build-favicons.mjs --mark mark.svg --out dir [--tile "#hex"] [--name "Name"] [--short-name "Short"]`
writes the same six files to `dir` only.

## Versioning, checksum and sync

- `manifest.json` holds the version (semver: patch = fix, minor = new token or class, major = rename or removal; a major bump also moves the published path to `/brand/v2/`), each file's sha256 (text hashed with LF line endings) and `checksum`, the sha256 of the sorted `"<sha>  <path>"` lines. `dh-tokens.css` also carries its own body checksum in its header.
- After any change here: `npm run shared:stamp` (add `-- --version 1.3.0` to bump). It also regenerates `dh-strip.html` and the current-site selectors in `dh-strip.css` from `dh-strip.mjs`. `npm run build` runs `shared:check` first and fails if the manifest, the header checksum or the landing's copies in `public/` are stale.
- Vendor into another repo (from this repo): `node scripts/sync-shared.mjs ../argus-studio --dest frontend/vendor/dh` (default dest `vendor/dh`). It copies the files (without `favicons/` unless `--with-favicons`, and without `dh-theme.js` if `--no-theme-script`) plus `manifest.json` and `sync-shared.mjs`, writes `.dh-shared.json` (version, checksum, dest, file hashes, left-out files) at the repo root, and deletes files an earlier sync vendored that are no longer in the set.
- Check in the target repo: `node vendor/dh/sync-shared.mjs --check .` fails if a vendored file was edited; add `--against https://dragonhound.dev/brand/v1/manifest.json` to also fail when it no longer matches the published source (`--allow-outdated` turns a newer upstream version into a warning).

- Test page (strip marking, `dhTheme` events and API, categorical swatches) in this repo: `node tests/shared/serve.mjs`, then open `http://localhost:4330/tests/shared/` (served with the site's CSP; it reports pass/fail on the page).

CI snippet for a target repo (GitHub Actions):

```yaml
  dh-shared:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with: { node-version: 22 }
      - run: node vendor/dh/sync-shared.mjs --check . --against https://dragonhound.dev/brand/v1/manifest.json --allow-outdated
```

## Adoption checklist (WP6 Studio, WP7 Lightbox and Realms)

1. Vendor: `node scripts/sync-shared.mjs <repo> [--dest …]`, commit `vendor/dh/` and `.dh-shared.json`, add the CI job above.
2. Tokens: load `dh-tokens.css` before the site's CSS (Tailwind: `@import` it, then map `@theme inline` to `--dh-*`). Replace local neutrals, radius, focus and status colours with tokens; keep only the product `--dh-accent`/`--dh-on-accent` override. Text on tints uses `-ink`.
3. Type: drop webfonts for `--dh-font` (Studio may keep Geist Mono for code via `--dh-mono` override, documented).
4. Theme: `dh-theme.js` in `<head>`, `data-dh-theme-toggle` on the toggle; remove the old theme code and any inline theme bootstrap (and its CSP hash). Lightbox: `data-theme="dark" data-dh-theme-lock`.
5. Strip: replace DemoBanner / the demo pill with the strip (`dh-strip.html`, or `dh-strip.mjs` rendered natively) + `dh-strip.css`, `data-dh-site="<site>"` on `<html>` (or `aria-current="page"` on your link in JSX), after the skip link, same-tab links.
6. Badges: `dh-badge.css` and the four labels above; remove the retired ones.
7. Favicons: Argus apps use the official set from argus-cortex `brand/` (not `favicons/` here); delete the old icons (Studio: the Next.js default).
8. Cards (where a site has them): the card-hover snippet above.
9. Verify: 390 px and 1440 px in both themes, toggle on one subdomain and reload another (cookie `Domain=.dragonhound.dev`), zero CSP errors, Lighthouse unchanged or better.

## Changelog

- **1.2.1**
  - `dh-strip.html`: the header comment no longer contains tag-like text (it said `<nav>` and `<html>`, which led to a
    bad partial paste); it names "the nav element" instead.
  - `sync-shared.mjs`: `--no-theme-script` leaves `dh-theme.js` out of a vendored copy for locked single-theme sites,
    recorded in `.dh-shared.json` so `--check`/`--against` still pass; `.mts` files are hashed as text.
  - `dh-strip.d.mts` (new): TypeScript declarations for `dh-strip.mjs`.
  - README: the 12 px floor is for UI text; map canvas labels may go to 11 px for minor places with a halo.

- **1.2.0**
  - `--dh-warn-ink` light `#8a5a00` → `#7a4f00` (4.3 → 5.2:1 on a 20% warn mix, 6.5:1 on `--dh-warn-tint`); status ink ratios documented per tint.
  - `--dh-cat-1..8` with `-ink` and `-tint`: colour-blind-aware categorical palette for facets and series.
  - `dh-theme.js`: `dh-theme-change` event, `dhTheme.effective()` and `.subscribe()`, `aria-pressed` kept in sync on toggles mounted later, strip current-site marking from `data-dh-site`; no unused `catch` binding.
  - `dh-strip.mjs` (new): the strip as an ES module; `dh-strip.html` and the strip's current-site CSS are generated from it. Links carry `data-dh-site`; `aria-current` is now `"page"`.
  - `sync-shared.mjs`: favicons left out of vendored copies unless `--with-favicons`; stale vendored files removed.
  - `build-favicons.mjs`: `--mark`, `--out`, `--tile`, `--name`, `--short-name`.
  - README: locked sites may skip `dh-theme.js`, never set `font` on `html`, text-size floor for dense UIs, Argus favicon rule.
- **1.1.0** `--dh-stage-data|training|apps|foundation` stage colours.
- **1.0.0** Tokens, badge, strip, theme, favicons.
