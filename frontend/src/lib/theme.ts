/**
 * Light/dark is the Dragonhound shared script, public/dh-theme.js (a copy of
 * vendor/dh/dh-theme.js; see dhShared.test.ts). It runs blocking in <head>, sets
 * `data-theme` on <html> before the first paint from a `dh-theme` cookie (Domain
 * .dragonhound.dev on the live hosts, so the choice follows you between the
 * family's sites), handles clicks on any `[data-dh-theme-toggle]` button and keeps
 * their `aria-pressed` in step, also for buttons mounted later.
 *
 * React only reads the effective scheme through the script's API (`dhTheme`),
 * for labels; it never writes the theme or `aria-pressed` itself.
